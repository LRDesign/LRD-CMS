  # REMEMBER:  attr_accessible :attr1, :attr2
  #
  # Logical Reality Projects set attr_accessible :nil by default for all
  # models. (see config/initializers/security_defaults.rb)  So if you don't
  # make your attributes accessible you won't be able to mass-assign them,
  # which can be a PITA to debug.  Please do this intelligently, and only for
  # attributes that should be assignable from a web form.  Things like a
  # User#admin boolean probably should not be accessible. :-)

  # you can use that then to set @valid_create_params and similar in
