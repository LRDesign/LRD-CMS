Suppose I want this:

config.generators do |g|
  g.template_engine 'lrd:haml'
  g.test_framework :rspec, :fixture => true, :views => false
  g.fixture_replacement 'lrd:factory'
end

The template generator must go in a "scaffold" class, because that's
what 'rails generate scaffold' looks for for the template.

module lrd
  module generators
    module haml
      class scaffold < Rails::Generators::NamedBase
end end end      

the files have to go in 
  lib/generators/lrd/haml/scaffold
  
Module/class namespace:
  Lrd::Generators::Haml::Scaffold
Filesystem namespace goes in a different order:
  generators/lrd/haml/scaffold
And the "Generator namespace" given in config.generators omits the 'scaffold'.
  lrd:haml                                                   
                                                          
  
With factories, it gets much worse.   If I create generator namespace
lrd:factory for fixture replacement, i either have to put it inside a
folder named 'rspec', or i have to name the generator 'model' rather than
'factory'.   Notice that all the ones with 'factory' as the class name
have to be inside an 'rspec' folder.  Gah!  

  "looking up path rails/generators/rspec/lrd/factory/factory_generator"
  "looking up path generators/rspec/lrd/factory/factory_generator"
  "looking up path rails/generators/rspec/lrd/factory_generator"
  "looking up path generators/rspec/lrd/factory_generator"
  "looking up path rails/generators/lrd/factory/model/model_generator"
  "looking up path generators/lrd/factory/model/model_generator"
  "looking up path rails/generators/lrd/factory/model_generator"
  "looking up path generators/lrd/factory/model_generator"  
                                          
So I end up with this:

Module/class namespace:
  Lrd::Generators::Factory
Filesystem namespace
  generators/rspec/lrd/factory/factory_generator
Generator namespace:
  lrd:haml
  
Seriously guys, there has to be an easier way.  If you're going to have
"convention over configuration" it really needs to be an understandable
convention.  I shouldn't have to put debugging lines in the Rails code to
try to figure out where to put my generator files because the system is
so obtuse and the docs are poor.
